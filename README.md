# Running Tests

Tests are run using the [Racket Command-Line-Tools](https://docs.racket-lang.org/raco/).
Make sure you have `Racket` installed and added to your `PATH`.

To run the tests, run the following command:
```bash
make test
```

This will run the test suite defined under the `test` directory.
